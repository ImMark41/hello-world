Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Aortic valve replacement done just like angioplasty.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) technique is novel treatment opportunity for patients who require a valve replacement, but are in-operable, or at an intermediate to high risk for surgical valve replacement procedure. Faster recovery time and long-term clinical benefits for patients are a few reasons for TAVRâ€™s growing popularity. For patients who are above 60 or 70 years of age or not physically fit to undergo the surgery or prone to a surgical complication, TAVR is a lifesaver. Additionally, the complication rates of a TAVR procedure are very low.

TAVR is a minimally invasive procedure that repairs the aortic heart valve without removing the old, damaged valve. Instead, like in Angioplasty, it inserts a replacement valve into the aortic valve's place, through a catheter or tube, inserted through the femoral artery (large artery in groin). 

At The Valve Clinic, we have an expert team of cardiologists who provide proper, comprehensive care for people undergoing TAVR. Our multi-disciplinary team of doctors takes time to understand your needs, completely study your case, and then plan the care for you, based on this information.
